# opplncRNA
opplncRNA: A MATLAB package for comprehensive pathway analysis of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA in human  The discovery of new lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) and their regulatory pathways has always been a hotspot in the field of ceRNA (competing endogenous RNA). Herein, we report opplncRNA (Omics Pilot Platform of lncRNA), a novel and rapid tool for investigating lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions based on the architecture of MATLAB AppDesigner. opplncRNA is useful to analyze the regulatory interaction networks of lncRNA with a friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface). There are three lncRNA databases (ENCORI, LncBase and miRcode) about lncRNA-miRNA interactions that have been integrated into opplncRNA, as well as seven miRNA databases (miRcode, ENCORI, TarBase, miRTarBase, miRDB, miRanda and miRecords) about miRNA-mRNA interactions as also. Users can directly calculate the relationship between lncRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA through the gene profile data of lncRNA, miRNA and mRNA by threshold of correlation coefficients. Integrated databases could be used to filter calculation outcomes to obtain more reliable pathways. Moreover, opplncRNA has the functionality of directly demonstrating network graphics to present 3 layers network interactions of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA in command line form.
